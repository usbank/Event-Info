### Challenge
Today many people struggle with managing and saving money.  Let's face it - saving isn't always fun, and the word ‘budget’ makes most people cringe! For this hackathon, we would like you to create solutions *to help students easily manage their finances so that they feel more successful saving and planning for the future*.

Using U.S. Bank API's along with other third party API's, build an innovative solution to help college students better manage their money while in school. Use your creativity, but remember, "simplicity is the key to success" to a time-crunched student.
